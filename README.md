# Adafruit 5664 Shield

This is a KiCad library representing the
[Adafruit PCA9546 4-Channel STEMMA QT / Qwiic I2C Multiplexer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5664),
as a shield.

This allows for a 4 Channel Qwiic I2C Multiplexer to be added to a PCB, without
the need for surface mount soldering.
